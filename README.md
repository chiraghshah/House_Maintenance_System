# House Maintenance System

The idea of the project is to develop a dynamic website that essentially maintains a tab of all the registered houses
and total maintenance expenditure, thereby easily facilitating reports on all the fixed assets and contents of a home
for managing future home selling or moving processes.
The website works well, but may need some modification as per the wants. 

Programming Language: PHP, HTML, JS, Bootstrap and SQL.

Code Structure:

1. The website is desgined using the CodeIgniter MVC framework.
2. The Controllers are under application/controllers, Models i.e. database queries are under application/models and all HTML frontend pages i.e. Views are in application/views.
3. Here I am already making use of CleanZone Bootstrap theme. So all UI related changes can be made in JS/CSS. Therefore, usage of application, JS, CSS, images, system is as per user discretion. The main functionality files are under  application/models, application/controllers and application/views.
4. A live version of this website running is at : https://chiragshah003.000webhostapp.com/
